# mandelbrot-rs

This implementation of the mandelbrot set is meant to train my skills on efficient code, concurrency and GUI with Rust.

To move into the set, use the following keys:
- `o` - Zoom Out
- `i` - Zoom In
- `l` - Left
- `r` - Right
- `t` - Top
- `b` - Bottom

### Missing features/Improvements
- Auto zooming animation
- Faster rendering
- Better color palette
